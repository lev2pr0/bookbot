# Bookbot ðŸ“š

## Purpose

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! This is a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within. The learning goals are to:

- Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
- Practice building a full project from scratch
- Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
- Learn how to use a professional code editor (Zed)
