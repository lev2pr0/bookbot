# Bookbot ðŸ“š

## Purpose

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! This is a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within. The learning goals are to:

- Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
- Practice building a full project from scratch
- Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
- Learn how to use a professional code editor (Zed)

For more, see [Boot.dev Achievements](https://github.com/lev2pr0/bootdotdevAchievements)

## Installation

1. Fork from the ``main`` branch
2. Download and open .zip from your forked repository
3. Add books as .txt files to ``./books`` folder

## Parameter

```python
python3 main.py <path_to_book>

- If not using the ``./books`` path, then you must use relative path to text file
